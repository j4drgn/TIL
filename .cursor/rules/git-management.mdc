# Git Management Rules

1. When adding projects with embedded Git repositories:
   - Remove internal .git directories before adding
   - Or add as submodules
2. Add unnecessary build files or temporary files to .gitignore
3. Do not commit auto-generated README.md files from frameworks like React
4. Wait for explicit approval before pushing changes to remote repository
   - Prepare all changes and commits locally first
   - Show the changes to be pushed
   - Push only after receiving explicit confirmation
